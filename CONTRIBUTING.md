# Pull Requests

Pull requests are welcome.
1. Fork the repository.
2. Make and test your changes (see Developer Guide below).
3. Run `poetry run black sarif` to format the code.
4. Run `poetry run pylint sarif` and check for no new errors or warnings.
5. Raise Pull Request in GitHub.com.

# Developer Guide

## Prerequisites

- You need Python 3.8 installed.
  - This is the minimum supported version of the tool.  Developing with a later version risks introducing type hints such as `list[dict]` that are not compatible with Python 3.8.
- You need Poetry installed.  Run this in an Admin CMD or under `sudo`:
  - `pip install poetry`

Initialise Poetry by telling it where Python 3.8 is, e.g.

```
# Windows - adjust to the path where you have installed Python 3.8.
poetry env use "C:\Python38\python.exe"
# Linux
poetry env use 3.8
```

This is not necessary if your system Python version is 3.8.

## Running locally in Poetry virtualenv

```
poetry install
poetry run sarif <OPTIONS>
```

To check that the right versions are being run:
```
poetry run python --version
poetry run sarif --version
poetry run python -m sarif --version
```

To see what executable is being run:
```
# Windows
poetry run cmd /c "where sarif"
# Linux
poetry run which sarif
```

## Update dependency versions

Run `poetry update` to bump package versions in the `poetry.lock` file.

## Update product version

Change the `version = ` line in `pyproject.toml` for the new semantic version for your change.

To make sure you're paying attention, you need to change it in the test `test_version.py` as well.

## Run unit tests
```
poetry run pytest
```

## Package using `poetry build`

Run it on the source code:
```
poetry build
```

If you want, you can install the package built locally at system level (outside the Poetry virtual environment):
```
pip install dist/sarif-*.whl
```

To remove it again:
```
pip uninstall sarif-tools
```

Note that there are two possible levels of installation:

### User installation

When you run `pip install` and `pip` doesn't have permissions to write to the Python installation's `site-packages` directory, probably because you are not running as an admin/superuser, the package is installed at "user" level only.  You can run it using:
```
python -m sarif
```
You *cannot* run it using the bare command `sarif`, unless you add your user-level `Scripts` directory to your `PATH`.  You can see where that is in the output from `pip install`:
```
Installing collected packages: sarif
  WARNING: The script sarif.exe is installed in 'C:\Users\yournamehere\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python39\Scripts' which is not on PATH.
  Consider adding this directory to PATH or, if you prefer to suppress this warning, use --no-warn-script-location.
```

### System installation
When you run `pip install` and `pip` has permissions to write to the Python installation's `site-packages` directory, and the Python installation's `Scripts` directory is in your path, then you can run the `sarif` command without `python -m`:
```
sarif
```

## Adding packages from pypi to the project

Add the package and its latest version number (as minimum version) to `[tool.poetry.dependencies]` in `pyproject.toml`.

Then run this to update Poetry's lockfile.
```
poetry update
```

## Adding resource files to the project

Add the file within the `sarif` directory and it will be installed with the Python source.  For example, `sarif/operations/templates/sarif_summary.html`.
